# Colorado Boulder MS-CS
This README encapsulates my academic journey towards my Master's in       
Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. Therefore,       
this document is alive document from the day I signed up, January     
4, 2025, to the day I finished, TBD (Hopefully, in 2 - 3 years).     
That means that there will be continuous updates as my coursework       
evolves.
